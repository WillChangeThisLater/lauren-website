# Lauren Torrance — Visual Art

## Overview
A neutral gallery-first slice of the eventual multimedia portfolio (music, writing, and visual art). The current focus is on a single Visual Art page with a responsive grid of 5–7 pieces and a shared lightbox for details. Future expansions will add the Music and Writing sections/pages alongside this layout.

## Running locally
- Start a simple web server from the project root:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server --bind 0.0.0.0 7777
  ```
- Open `http://localhost:7777` in a browser to view the page.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Visual Art page featuring the gallery grid, featured series callout, and shared lightbox.
- `fuck-life.html` — Dedicated story for the “Fuck Life” book/art project, covering the work’s concept, process, and featured visuals. More media and companion audio links will live here as the project develops.
- Future pages (to be added):
  - Music — showcase recordings, embedded tracks, and release notes.
  - Writing — highlight essays, poems, and publication blurbs.
