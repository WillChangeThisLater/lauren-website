# Agent Instructions

## Big rules (always)
1. Read the latest `DESIGN.md` before starting any work so you understand the high-level goals and constraints.
2. Keep every change simple and spartan—avoid unnecessary complexity when editing or adding files.

## Small rule (currently only one rule)
- Whenever a new page is added to the site, update `README.md` with the page path and a short description of what that page captures.
